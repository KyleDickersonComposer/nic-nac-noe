# This is my python project for Sophia where I will create a version of the tic-tac-toe game that supports n by n matrices where n = n.
- If the length of the matrices are equal length, I should be able to create an algorithm that applies the rules of tic-tac-toe correctly for any matrix size.
- Optionally, I will add support for a powerup denoted by the character "-" that destroys all x's and o's in a - pattern. (Also, a "/" that destroys all x's and o's in a / pattern. also adding the inverse with the "\" character. And a "|" powerup, again the pipe following the same logic.
- The player may place their piece ontop of the power-up to trigger it. Their piece should not be destroyed.
