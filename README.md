# Nic-Nac-Noe: variant of tic-toe-toe with square matrices of arbitrary size
- If the length of the matrices are equal length, I should be able to create an algorithm that applies the rules of tic-tac-toe correctly for any matrix size.
- I will add support for a powerup denoted by the character "-" that destroys the opposite pieces only in a - pattern. (Also, a "/" that destroys the same in a / pattern. also adding the inverse with the "\" character. And a "|" powerup, again the pipe following the same logic.
- The player may place their piece ontop of the power-up to trigger it. Their piece should not be destroyed.
